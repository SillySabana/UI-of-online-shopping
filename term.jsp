            By placing an order with Legal Ease Consulting, Inc.
            through the Lawyer Meltdown site, you are accepting these Terms & Conditions.
            Please read these Terms & Conditions before placing an order.</p>

        <p style="text-align: justify"> In these Terms & Conditions
            "We" and "us" means Lawyer Meltdown and Legal Ease Consulting, Inc.
            "You" means the person placing an order.</p>

        <p style="text-align: justify">  "The contract is agreed"  by completing and submitting an electronic order form,
            you are making an offer to purchase products which, if accepted by us, will result in a binding contract.
            An acceptance email from us confirms that the contract is formed.</p>

        <p style="text-align: justify"> By using the website to buy products online, you confirm that you are at least 18 years old. </p>

        <p style="text-align: justify">Ordering
            By completing and submitting an electronic order form, you are making an offer to purchase goods which,
            if accepted by us, will result in a binding contract.
            Please note that products will not be sent (or links to online products) until we have authorization
            from your payment card issuer.
            We will not be liable if there is a delay, and we will not accept your order if payment is not authorized. </p>

        <p style="text-align: justify">Certain steps must be followed for a contract to be formed, as described below. </p>

        <p style="text-align: justify">   After you have placed your order: </p>

        <p style="text-align: justify">  You will receive an email to acknowledge your order. It will confirm which products you have ordered.
            This email is not an order acceptance from us. </p>

        <p style="text-align: justify"> When an order for downloadable e-books, audios, or other downloadable products has been placed,
            you will be redirected to a ‘thank you’ page which will require you to verify your name and email address. Once that information has been verified, you will be redirected to a download page which will allow you to download the purchased content. You will also receive an email containing the link to the download page.

        <p style="text-align: justify"> We do not have the products in stock
            Your payment is not authorized
            There is an error on our website regarding the price or other details of the products
            You have cancelled it in accordance with the instructions below
            We reserve the right to refuse any order. </p>

        <p style="text-align: justify">Cancelling an order before the product has been sent </p>

        <p style="text-align: justify"> If you change your mind after placing an order, you can cancel it at any time before we send it. Please see the Contact us page for our telephone number. You will need to give us your name and address details, as well as your order number to cancel your order.
        </p>
        Returning products after sending

        Each product sold through Legal Ease Consulting, Inc. and the Lawyer Meltdown site is guaranteed. If you are not satisfied with the product after receiving it, contact us for return of the payment price, as indicated in the guarantee.
        Pricing and payment
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            Prices throughout the website are quoted in U.S. dollars, and payment can only be accepted in U. S. Dollars. Packing and delivery costs, if any, will be added to the total price of your purchase.</p>

        <p style="text-align: justify"> While we make every effort to ensure that the products shown on our website are currently available at the price shown, we cannot guarantee that this will always be the case. If products you have ordered are unavailable, you will be notified as soon as possible.</p>

        <p style="text-align: justify">  The price you pay is the price of the products shown at the time you place your order, even if the price of the product has since changed.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            Your payment card will be debited for your order at the time the order is placed. By submitting an online order with Legal Ease Consulting, Inc. through the Lawyer Meltdown website, you expressly agree not to request a 'charge back' of any fees or payments for said orders, and that no dispute with Legal Ease Consulting will be raised with or adjudicated by the credit card company. Rather, you agree to contact Legal Ease Consulting, Inc. directly to resolve the issue or obtain a refund pursuant to the product guarantee.</p>

        <p style="text-align: justify"> Where an offer mentions that an item is reduced in price, eg: half-price, the discount will be calculated at checkout before any postage or packaging charges are applied.</p>

        <p style="text-align: justify">   Delivery information</p>

        <p style="text-align: justify"> Please see individual product sales pages for information about delivery and shipping charges, where applicable.</p>

        <p style="text-align: justify"> For products that require shipping, we will email you as soon as your order has been shipped, and will advise of the shipping method (if any) at that time.</p>

        <p style="text-align: justify"> Changes to Terms & Conditions for buying products online </p>

        <p style="text-align: justify"> We reserve the right to change these Terms & Conditions for buying products online from time to time. If this happens, we will notify you by posting the new Terms & Conditions for buying products online on the website. If you do not wish to be governed by the revised Terms & Conditions for buying products online, you must not place any further orders. </p>

        <p style="text-align: justify"> These Terms & Conditions for buying products online are governed by the law of the United States and the State of New York and you and we agree to use the New York courts should any dispute arise. </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            If any part of these Terms & Conditions for buying products online is found to be invalid by law, the rest of them remain valid and enforceable. </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            Thank you,
        </p>
